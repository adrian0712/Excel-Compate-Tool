# Excel-Compate-Tool
Excel Compare tool between two xls files


The code does a direct comparison of two xls files. 
If the files have the same tabs then the tabs will be compared otherwise will compare only the tabs that are common between the two files.

You will need to create a xls\diffs folder on your C:\ root.  

The code will open the files, split the tabs, copy the old tab in the new file and then populate a formula and display 
the results in the form once the code has finished.

This will be updated further on to add dynamic selection of which ranges to compare.

Enjoy.
